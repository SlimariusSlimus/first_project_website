                <div class="box">
                    <p>Sloths are slow-moving animals that live in the rainforests of Central and South America. They spend most of their time in trees and are known for their leisurely lifestyle. There are two main types: the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth, which are distinguished by the number of toes they have.</p>
                    <p>They spend about 20 hours a day sleeping or resting. Their slow pace of life is due to their slow digestion and low metabolism. Sloths are excellent climbers and spend almost their entire lives in trees, where they feel safe.</p>
                    <p>Another interesting characteristic of sloths is their unique way of moving. They hang from branches with their strong claws and move in very slow, steady motions. These slow movements help them conserve energy and avoid detection by natural predators.</p>

                    <h2>Interesting Facts About Sloths</h2>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sloths sleep up to 20 hours a day. Their slow lifestyle helps them conserve energy due to their very slow metabolism.</li>
                            <li>Sloths move so slowly that algae can grow on their fur. This gives them a greenish tint that provides additional camouflage from predators.</li>
                            <li>Sloths have the slowest metabolism of all mammals. This means they use very little energy and take long breaks between meals.
                            <li>Skilled climbers: Despite their slow movements, sloths are excellent climbers. They spend almost their entire lives in trees and can even hang upside down without losing their grip.
                            <li>Sloths have especially strong claws that help them cling to branches. Their movement is so slow and steady that they are not easily detected by natural predators.

                    <h2>Lifestyle of Sloths</h2>
                    <p>Sloths are herbivores and spend most of their lives sleeping or resting. They move very slowly because their metabolism is extremely low. Their digestive system is also slow, which means they often take several days to digest their food.</p>
                    <p>Another characteristic of sloths is their close relationship with trees. They climb with their strong claws and spend almost the entire day in the treetops. Trees provide them not only with food but also with protection from predators such as jaguars or snakes.</p>
                    <p>Although sloths are generally solitary animals, they can sometimes be observed in small groups in certain regions. They are nocturnal and rarely come down to the ground, as their slow movements make them vulnerable to predators.</p>
